She is a Caucasian woman who was born and raised in the United States of America.&nbsp;She had a great background of hard work and ambition from her parents who had a homefront juggling mother and a job as a marketing communications manager for a service unit of a French transport and power equipment company.</span></p><p><span>For her graduate education, she attended the Elliott School of International Affairs at George Washington University, where she received a bachelor’s degree in international affairs.&nbsp;During her studies she had decided to focus on media and communication.&nbsp;She therefore began her career on local networks to hone her skills before finally getting a job working as a weekend reporter for WLJA, an ABC staffer in Washington, DC.</span></p><p><span>Shortly thereafter, she became a reporter for ABC News, covering Congress, focusing on the US Senate.&nbsp;She has also been a regular contributor to&nbsp;</span><span>ABC NewsNow</span><span>&nbsp;, the network’s broadband entity, while a regular subscription to ABCNews.com.&nbsp;Sunlen Serfaty’s hard work didn’t go unnoticed and in two years, by 2008, she was hired as part of the ABC crew of reporters tasked with covering story development at the White House.</span></p><p><span>Her new appointment, which came as President Barack Obama entered the White House, allowed her to further distinguish herself on the network, and she has served on a variety of its platforms, including&nbsp;</span><span>This Week with George Stephanopoulos</span><span>&nbsp;,&nbsp;</span><span>World News with Charles Gibson</span><span>&nbsp;, and&nbsp;</span><span>Politics live</span><span>&nbsp;.</span></p><span>With her specific experience reporting for political campaigns and the White House, it came as no surprise that CNN came for her and, as expected, she was delighted to say yes.&nbsp;At CNN, she worked with&nbsp;</span><span>CNN News Source</span><span>&nbsp;at her Washington Bureau before becoming a general operational crew for CNN in Washington DC</span><p><span>Sunlen Serfaty has won an Emmy in Journalism for her outstanding reporting and level of dedication to her work.&nbsp;and her good work in 2016, covering one of the most closely contested presidential elections in United States history, showed why.&nbsp;Her reports came from across the country as she ran with the GOP nominees during the Republican primary.</span></p><h2><strong><span>Wealth (income and earnings)</span></strong></h2><p><span>Sunlen Serfarty net worth details are:closed to the public.&nbsp;However, it is evident that she has thrived in her chosen career and has become one of America’s most respected journalists.&nbsp;Her net worth, whatever the level, would expect healthy contributions from her work as a White House correspondent, and her annual salary is estimated at $126,000.</span></p><h2><strong><span>Sunlen Serfaty’s husband</span></strong></h2><p><span>Sunlen Serfaty dated her husband for quite a long time before marrying him on August 3, 2013 in Rose Park, Washington.&nbsp;Her husband, Alexis Serfaty, is a policy advisor at the Washington Department of Transportation.&nbsp;Introduced by a mutual friend, the two hit it off and began communicating regularly, which led to a date at Firefly’s in Dupont.</span></p><p><span>The date was obviously successful as they went on to a second and then a third, and they were soon inseparable, finally taking the plunge into marriage.&nbsp;In 2017, their union was blessed with a daughter they named Roosevelt Jolie Serfaty.&nbsp;Their daughter Roosevelt’s name has some meaning to their relationship as it stands for “Rosenfeld” and they shared many sweet memories in Rose Park, Washington, DC.</span></p><h2><strong><span>Height</span></strong></h2><p><span>Sunlen Serfaty stands at a height of 6 feet or 182cm.&nbsp;That’s reasonably high, not that it matters, because while looks may play a part in the journalism profession, it certainly counts for little compared to the hard work and dedication Sunlen Serfaty has shown throughout her career.</span></p><h3 class=main-box-title>You may also like</h3><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7r63Io5innaeoe6S7zGiZrrKqZL2mu8%2BlnGivmKR6qr%2BMrKynpJWjerSx0Z%2BYrbFdl7awecStn6ehk57BunnHrqqbmZ6ZeqKzxGafnqGXncFuusStZLCnoqm1cA%3D%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
