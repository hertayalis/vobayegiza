It would be hard to discuss ABC's firefighter drama Station 19 without including the character Jack Gibson. Grey Damon's firefighter has been with the series from its very first episode, and for the first two seasons he was the show's male lead."><link rel=stylesheet href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/cayman/css/normalize.css><link href="https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans:400,700" rel=stylesheet type=text/css><link rel=stylesheet href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/cayman/css/cayman.css><link rel=apple-touch-icon sizes=180x180 href=./apple-touch-icon.png><link rel=icon type=image/png sizes=32x32 href=./favicon-32x32.png><link rel=icon type=image/png sizes=16x16 href=./favicon-16x16.png><link rel=stylesheet href=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/katex@0.10.2/dist/katex.min.css integrity=sha384-yFRtMMDnQtDRO8rLpMIKrtPCD5jdktao2TV19YiZYWMDkUR5GQZR/NOVTdquEx1j crossorigin=anonymous><script defer src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/katex@0.10.2/dist/katex.min.js integrity=sha384-9Nhn55MVVN0/4OFx7EE5kpFBPsEMZxKTCnA+4fqDmg12eCTqGi6+BB2LjY8brQxJ crossorigin=anonymous></script>

Grey Damon's firefighter has been with the series from its very first episode, and for the first two seasons he was the show's male lead.</p><p>But when other main characters were added to Station 19, Jack went off on his own path, and he acts as a support for other characters as much as he has his own stories.</p><p>However, fans have been worried about Jack since Season 5 of the show, when he (briefly) left after details surfaced about Jack's childhood, including family members he didn't know he had. Now, his past has come back to haunt him for a second time, making fans wonder: Will Grey Damon be continuing his run on Station 19?</p><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><span>Source: ABC</span><p>Jaina Lee Ortiz and Grey Damon in 'Station 19'</p></figure><h2 data-header=true class="sc-bTJPMs hHQrGE">Is Grey Damon leaving 'Station 19'?</h2><p>Jack had a really rough end to Season 5, which is why it was surprising for many that he found it within himself to come back. Andy (Jaina Lee Ortiz) stumbled upon Jack's empty locker with a cryptic note that read, "You're welcome." Thankfully, during Season 6 of Station 19, it was revealed that Jack didn't leave for good.</p><p>After Jack returned, he didn't tell anyone except Eva Vasquez, Rigo's widow. The only reason anyone from Station 19 discovered Jack was still in town was because he required their rescue services when a tornado knocked down a tree that crashed into Eva's house.</p><p>Regardless, his friends have been determined to help him get back on his feet, with Andy even telling him in a recent episode, "You've fought hard for this career. It's time to save it. Come with me."</p><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><span>Source: ABC</span></figure><p>However, during Season 6 Episode 5, "Pick Up the Pieces," Jack seems to be in a worse state than people realize. Ben (Jason George) discovers Jack sleeping in his car and brings him to the Crisis One emergency clinic. The duo argues, with Ben trying to get Jack to realize people care about him while Jack criticizes the clinic. Ben then challenges Jack to "come and fix it" and offers to let him sleep on a cot in the firehouse.</p><p>But that's not all —&nbsp;a young woman at the clinic notices Jack's arrival and passes off an envelope address to Jack to Carina (Stefania Spampinato). In the meantime, Jack tells Andy he will be talking to Chief Ross about coming back!</p><p>It sounds like Jack isn't leaving Station 19 anytime soon, and neither is Grey Damon.</p><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><span>Source: ABC</span></figure><p>When Jack finally opens the envelope from the clinic, the sender is revealed to be a woman named Brooke, who claims to be Jack's sister. With a new family mystery to unravel and a return to the firehouse, it seems like Jack is finally on the mend.</p><p>Catch new episodes of <a href=#>Station 19</a> on ABC at 8 p.m. EST ahead of Grey's Anatomy.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7pbXSramam6Ses7p6wqikaKhfnsButsCcomafmZfAsLqMpZyarpmjtG6%2F05qroqeeYn56</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
