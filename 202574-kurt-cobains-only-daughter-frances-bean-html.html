Her mother <a class="me a" href=# rel="noopener noreferrer" aria-label=https://people.com/music/courtney-love-frances-bean-cobain-out-of-spotlight-normal-childhood/>also attested that she tried</a> to ensure that Frances grew up with reasonable conditions for a child born into fame.</p><p class=dh>Although she never got to meet her father, the news, his songs, and talks about him were enough to give her the information that she needed to know about him although not in the manner that she would have preferred.</p><p class=dh>Recalling how people often compare her to her father, Frances<a class="me a" href=# rel="noopener noreferrer" aria-label=https://www.rollingstone.com/music/music-features/frances-bean-cobain-on-life-after-kurts-death-an-exclusive-qa-186561/> remembered a time when</a> the members of Nirvana came visiting and could not stop staring at her like they had seen a ghost because of her uncanny resemblance to Kurt.</p><p class=dh>With both parents in the limelight, Frances got exposed to fame at a young age but has since created her own path to live her life on her own terms.</p><p class=dh><strong class=bh>MOTHER-DAUGHTER RELATIONSHIP</strong></p><p class=dh>Frances and Courtney Love <a class="me a" href=# rel="noopener noreferrer" aria-label=https://edition.cnn.com/2009/SHOWBIZ/Music/12/14/courtney.love.custody/index.html>did not have the best </a>mother-daughter relationship while she was growing up.
