Recognized as a moderate conservative, O’Connor gained renown for her meticulously researched opinions. Appointed by President Ronald Reagan, she played a pivotal role as a swing vote during the Rehnquist Court and the initial months of the Roberts Court.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading>Who was Sandra Day O’Connor’s Husband?</h2><p>During her last year at Stanford Law School, Sandra Day entered into a relationship with John Jay O’Connor III, a fellow student who was a year junior to her in class. Their courtship unfolded, and six months following her graduation, on December 20, 1952, Sandra and John tied the knot at her family’s ranch, marking the beginning of a lifelong commitment. Tragically, John Jay O’Connor III battled Alzheimer’s disease for nearly two decades, enduring the challenges of the condition until his passing in 2009. Sandra, having witnessed the impact of Alzheimer’s firsthand, became actively involved in raising awareness about the disease, dedicating her efforts to fostering understanding and support for affected individuals and their families.</p><p>Before joining the Supreme Court, O’Connor had a distinguished career in Arizona, where she served as a judge and became the first female majority leader of a state senate as the Republican leader in the Arizona Senate. Upon her nomination to the Court, O’Connor received unanimous confirmation from the Senate. In a significant announcement on July 1, 2005, she revealed her decision to retire, contingent upon the confirmation of her successor. Samuel Alito was nominated to fill her seat in October 2005 and officially joined the Court on January 31, 2006.</p><p>Sandra Day O’Connor frequently aligned with the Court’s conservative bloc but exhibited a capacity to join the Court’s liberal members on certain issues. She was known for crafting concurring opinions that aimed to narrow the scope of majority holdings. Her majority opinions in landmark cases, such as Grutter v. Bollinger and Hamdi v. Rumsfeld, showcased her influential role. Additionally, O’Connor played a significant part in the per curiam majority opinion in Bush v. Gore and co-authored the lead opinion in Planned Parenthood v. Casey alongside two other justices.</p><p>Throughout her tenure on the Court, Sandra Day O’Connor earned recognition as one of the most powerful women globally in various publications. Post-retirement, she assumed the role of Chancellor of the College of William & Mary, succeeding Henry Kissinger. In a commendation by President Barack Obama on August 12, 2009, O’Connor was awarded the Presidential Medal of Freedom.</p><p>Sandra Day O’Connor’s academic journey began at Stanford University at the age of 16. Graduating magna cum laude with a B.A. in economics in 1950, she pursued her law degree at Stanford Law School, where she served on the Stanford Law Review alongside future Supreme Court Chief Justice William Rehnquist. Despite a dating history in 1950, the relationship ended before Rehnquist’s early graduation and move to Washington, D.C. He proposed to her in 1951, among four proposals she received while at Stanford, but she did not accept. Notably, she achieved the distinction of Order of the Coif, indicating her placement in the top 10 percent of her class.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7qLTGqKqsoaBjsLC5jrCfqGWnlsBuv8Cnm6uZXZmuunnOnKanpp%2BnwG601KyZmqaUZA%3D%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
