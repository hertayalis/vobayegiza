We're talking rhinestone-studded eyelids, delicate face jewels, and different variations of the red lip. And if you're a traditionalist at heart, there is no need to worry. Those mainstay looks — a bold lip, neutral palettes, and long lashes — will still be huge through the 2023 wedding season.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_3-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">So if you're looking for some wedding inspo, see what the experts predict will be the biggest bridal makeup trends of the year.

Celebrity makeup artist <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=1>Neil Scibelli</a> says that red lips and minimal makeup have been trending for a while and will continue to be big this year and beyond. "It's a timeless way to wear a pop of color without having to wear too much makeup," he says. "I've personally loved creating looks featuring a red lip for weddings which can be worn in all seasons. You can also find your red with variations of orangey reds, deep reds, and classic reds."</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_11-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">His personal go-to for wedding lips is <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=1 rel=nofollow>Neutrogena's MoistureSmooth Color Sticks</a>. "They come in a range of beautiful wearable colors that are perfect for a wedding day, and they also leave a hydrated glow on the lips for a long-lasting pout," he says. "I’ve used the shade in classic red on brides before, as well as the plums and [neutrals] on brides. They’re also easy and ideal for touching up."</p><span class=heading-toc id=toc-rhinestone-lids></span><h2 id=mntl-sc-block_12-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block instyle-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-list-item-title"><span class=mntl-sc-block-heading__text>Rhinestone Lids</span></h2><figure id=mntl-sc-block_13-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block instyle-sc-block-image mntl-sc-block-universal-image mntl-sc-block-image--no-theme no-theme mntl-sc-block-image figure-square figure-high-res"><span class=figure-article-caption-owner readability=27><p>Instagram @valentina1121li</p></span></figure><p id=mntl-sc-block_14-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Davy is also a huge fan of adding some special sparkle to your eyes with tiny rhinestones on the eyelids. "Tiny rhinies (as I call them) are actually super dainty and understated," she says.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_15-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">She recommends something like the <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=1 rel=nofollow>Half Magic Beauty Stick-On Face Gems</a>&nbsp;for rhinestones that are easy to put on for a disco-inspired reception and last all day (or night) long.</p><span class=heading-toc id=toc-statement-lashes></span><h2 id=mntl-sc-block_16-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block instyle-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-list-item-title"><span class=mntl-sc-block-heading__text>Statement Lashes</span></h2><figure id=mntl-sc-block_17-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block instyle-sc-block-image mntl-sc-block-universal-image mntl-sc-block-image--no-theme no-theme mntl-sc-block-image figure-portrait figure-high-res"><span class=figure-article-caption-owner><p>Getty Images</p></span></figure><p id=mntl-sc-block_18-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Scibelli confirms that lashes are always a statement trend for weddings. They can give the eyes more depth and add volume to your natural lashes. For either false lashes or extensions, he recommends going for a medium-style lash that it's not too overpowering yet still full enough to pop in photos.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_19-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">For false lashes especially, he says you'll want to make sure you're going with something that is lightweight and has a flexible band so that it stays on all night. We like <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=1 rel=nofollow>Lashify's The Fluffy Wing Gossamer Set</a> for its natural-looking length and volume.</p><span class=heading-toc id=toc-neutral-palettes></span><h2 id=mntl-sc-block_20-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block instyle-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-list-item-title"><span class=mntl-sc-block-heading__text>Neutral Palettes</span></h2><figure id=mntl-sc-block_21-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block instyle-sc-block-image mntl-sc-block-universal-image mntl-sc-block-image--no-theme no-theme mntl-sc-block-image figure-portrait figure-high-res"><span class=figure-article-caption-owner><p>Instagram @jlo</p></span></figure><p id=mntl-sc-block_22-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">If minimal makeup is your vibe, Pimentel says to go for a neutral palette that brings out your natural features. "This can be achieved with a simple nude-toned smoky eye and a glossy [bare] lip," she says. She recommends using something like <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=1>CTZN Nudiversal Duo in Fez</a>&nbsp;for a good neutral lip.</p><span class=heading-toc id=toc-candlelit-skin></span><h2 id=mntl-sc-block_23-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block instyle-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-list-item-title"><span class=mntl-sc-block-heading__text>Candlelit Skin</span></h2><figure id=mntl-sc-block_24-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block instyle-sc-block-image mntl-sc-block-universal-image mntl-sc-block-image--no-theme no-theme mntl-sc-block-image figure-portrait figure-high-res"><span class=figure-article-caption-owner><p>Getty Images</p></span></figure><p id=mntl-sc-block_25-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Having a natural glow is one of the most-requested looks Scibelli gets when he's working with brides. "Bridal makeup should enhance one's existing, natural features without feeling overpowering. So, glowing skin is always trending," he says. "It's important to feel and look like yourself on your big day."</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_26-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">He recommends prepping your skin with hydrating and brightening skincare to create the ideal canvas for makeup. When looking at base makeup, he says to go for foundations that offer a "candlelit effect," which he says is a romantic, lit-from-within finish.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_27-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Don't forget the body when it comes to your glow. As an alternative to getting a spray tan, he says to use something like the <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=1 rel=nofollow>Jergens Natural Glow Daily Moisturizer</a> to get an even, natural-looking color. "This is a streak-free, natural glow that works gradually to tan and hydrates the body while — most importantly — [is] transfer-proof," he says. "The color won’t bleed onto any fabrics, and it gives the most beautiful hint of color without being overpowering."</p><span class=heading-toc id=toc-face-jewels></span><h2 id=mntl-sc-block_28-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block instyle-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-list-item-title"><span class=mntl-sc-block-heading__text>Face Jewels</span></h2><figure id=mntl-sc-block_29-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block instyle-sc-block-image mntl-sc-block-universal-image mntl-sc-block-image--no-theme no-theme mntl-sc-block-image figure-portrait figure-high-res"><span class=figure-article-caption-owner><p>Getty Images</p></span></figure><p id=mntl-sc-block_30-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">"Face crystals are a fun way to dress up a makeup look on a wedding day...for that extra spark," says Scibelli. "It's also a fun party look for the evening." He especially likes jewels along the brow bone and the inner and outer corners of the eyes.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7qrrSrbClnV6YvK571p6bnaGenHqurcqerKllpKeyr7DSZmlpamNihHSCmG9ncQ%3D%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
