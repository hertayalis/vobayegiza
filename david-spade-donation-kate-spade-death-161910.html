"Fuzzy picture but I love it," he wrote on an image of the pair looking at each other and giggling. "Kate and I during Christmas family photos. We had so much fun that day. She was so sharp and quick on her feet. She could make me laugh so hard. I still cant believe it." David was clearly blindsided by the news that Kate had taken her own life, and he pleaded with fans to avoid the same. "It's a rough world out there people, try to hang on," he ended his message.</p><p>Many celebrities sent their love in the comments. Whitney Cummings sent hearts to her friend, while Kate Beckinsale wrote, "lots of love to you and your family. I'm so sorry this has happened." Jessica Alba wrote, "I'm so sorry David," while Cindy Crawford sent prayer emojis. Our heart goes out to David and the rest of the family in this devastating moment.</p><p><strong>If you or someone you know is contemplating suicide, call the</strong> <a href=# title=_self><strong>National Suicide Prevention Lifeline</strong></a> <strong>at 1-800-273-8255.</strong></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7pLjOrJyrr5WauK3FjZympmegpMC1v46dmK%2BhlGLAsa3DnmSdp56Wwaq7zWaimqyVYsCxrcOeZJ2dkam1bn2VanBqaF8%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
