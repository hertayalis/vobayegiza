Jonathan Smith is one of the more underrated coaches in the country and led the Beavers to a 10-3 season a year ago. That momentum has carried over into 2023 as Oregon State is off to a 3-0 start and ranked 14th in the country."><link rel=stylesheet href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/cayman/css/normalize.css><link href="https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans:400,700" rel=stylesheet type=text/css><link rel=stylesheet href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/cayman/css/cayman.css><link rel=apple-touch-icon sizes=180x180 href=./apple-touch-icon.png><link rel=icon type=image/png sizes=32x32 href=./favicon-32x32.png><link rel=icon type=image/png sizes=16x16 href=./favicon-16x16.png><link rel=stylesheet href=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/katex@0.10.2/dist/katex.min.css integrity=sha384-yFRtMMDnQtDRO8rLpMIKrtPCD5jdktao2TV19YiZYWMDkUR5GQZR/NOVTdquEx1j crossorigin=anonymous><script defer src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/katex@0.10.2/dist/katex.min.js integrity=sha384-9Nhn55MVVN0/4OFx7EE5kpFBPsEMZxKTCnA+4fqDmg12eCTqGi6+BB2LjY8brQxJ crossorigin=anonymous></script>

This conference is loaded with elite quarterbacks, which makes winning on the road especially difficult.</p><p>However, defense travels.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading>Oregon State vs. Washington State prediction</h2><p>(7 p.m. ET., Fox Sports)</p><p>The Pac-12 is known for high-flying offensive attacks, but the Beavers boast one of the best defenses in the country and have the ingredients necessary to slow down Washington State quarterback Cameron Ward.</p><p>Trent Bray is back for his second full season as Oregon State’s defensive coordinator.</p><p>In Bray’s first season, the Beavers led the Pac-12 in points per game allowed (20), rushing yards per game allowed (108.2), passes defended (71) and opponent red-zone efficiency (66.7%).</p><p>Oregon State also allowed the fewest plays of 10 or more yards.</p><p>So far, the Beavers defense is off to another strong start.</p><p>Oregon State, albeit in a small sample size, is allowing just 11 points and 260 yards per game and leads the conference with 12 sacks.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/nypost.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2023/09/oregon-state-1.jpg><p>I don’t expect Oregon State to pitch a shutout as Ward is playing well, and the Cougars are averaging 48 points per game, but this will be the toughest test Washington State’s offense has faced this season.</p><p>Additionally, Ward struggled against the Beavers last season. Yes, he threw for 345 yards, but Bray’s scheme limited Ward to just one touchdown as he went 25-for-54 (46%) and threw an interception in a 24-10 loss.</p><p>It’s also worth noting that Ward will need to increase his efficiency and maximize Washington State’s opportunities, as the Beavers are likely to run the ball and shorten this game.</p><p>Oregon State is rushing for 219 yards per game and sophomore running back Damien Martinez, who is averaging an absurd 8.8 yards per carry, is leading the conference with 351 rushing yards.</p><p>The Beavers have a balanced offensive attack and don’t air it out as much as others in this conference, but they’ve upgraded at quarterback.</p><p>Oregon State’s quarterbacks limited the Beavers last season, but Clemson transfer DJ Uiagalelei raises the ceiling.</p><p>Uiagalelei has played fine (61.8% completions, six touchdowns, two interceptions), and if he keeps that up, the Beavers will put together another solid season.</p><p>However, if the former five-star recruit takes a step forward, the Beavers could contend for the Pac-12 title.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/nypost.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2023/09/washington-state.jpg><p>This game should be a battle, which is why the spread is hovering around a field goal, but I’m going to back the better defense.</p><p>Ward has yet to throw an interception this season, but he threw nine last year and I wouldn’t be shocked if the Beavers bait him into a turnover or two on Saturday.</p><p><strong>The prediction:</strong> Beavers -3 or better (<a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">FanDuel</a>)</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmimqaW8tMCNnKamZ2Jlf3R7j3Jma2tfpL%2Bms86nZKyskamybsLSZq6aq5ieu6jAzqdkrKyRqbJuvNGem6KbpJ68r3nCqKOlnZeaeqe7zq2ZmqScYrylsNJmp6Kbm6h8</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
