In addition to his seven great-grandchildren, he is survived by his five grandchildren: Robin Holley (of Canton, Georgia), J.J.

Born on March 30, 1921, in a small town not far from Copperhill, Tennessee to the late Leland B. and Margaret Mowry. His father was working for the Celanese Corporation, thus the family relocated to Rome when he was young.</p><p>Soon after his return to Rome, Lee was hired as an entry-level sports reporter for the Floyd County Herald. It was in 1947 that he got his start in radio and sports broadcasting when he was invited to call a Textile League baseball game. He broadcasted Little League, Pony League, and Colt League baseball games, as well as high school football, college basketball, and professional golf, for more than 40 years in the Rome area.</p><p>He has spoken with hundreds of athletes over the years, including legends such as Ted Williams, Hank Aaron, Stan Musial, Al Kaline, Red Grange, and Dizzy Dean. He attended St. Peter’s Episcopal Church, was a member of the Marine Corps League’s Jake Puryear Detachment, and was the first broadcaster to be inducted into the Rome and Floyd Sports Hall of Fame. He, too, spent a number of years as the morning radio host of the Grab Bag show.</p><p>Thanks for reading from <a href=# rel=noopener>Ghsplash</a> a news publishing website from Ghana.
