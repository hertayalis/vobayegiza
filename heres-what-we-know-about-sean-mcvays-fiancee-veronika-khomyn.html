His fiance, Veronika Khomyn, is from Ukraine and with the Russian invasion of the country on February 24, she took to Instagram. "I don't know what I feel at this point," she <a href=#>wrote</a> in a caption. "But it is anger, sadness, I feel disappointment in the rest of the world, and more than anything I feel guilt for not being able to be there with my family during this time."</p><p dir=ltr>A week later, McVay spoke at a videoconference and addressed the situation — particularly on his wife's personal ties to the matter, per the <a href=#>Los Angeles Times</a>. "Just watching the grace at which she's handled this, how strong her family's been in the midst of this, I'm just so proud to be associated with that culture." He continued with compliments to President Zelenskyy's handling of the war and sent kind words to the people of Ukraine.</p><p dir=ltr>When the couple took the stage at the <a href=#>2022 Critics Choice Awards</a> in March as presenters for the final award of the evening, McVay gave his fiance a moment to address the matter, per <a href=#>Daily Mail</a>. Khomyn stated her pride and admiration of those in Ukraine. "There is no place for this kind of violence in our world and our prayers go out to all the lives that have been lost," she said as the audience applauded in overwhelming support.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7r7XCpKCsr5mbwW%2BvzqZma2tmZoJxe8eeqZ6rXay1osCMsJxmo56kxG6twaisrWWjmq6vecycrZqxo2Kzqq3NnJyeZaaav7C6yKSYZqOYpLq6uo4%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
