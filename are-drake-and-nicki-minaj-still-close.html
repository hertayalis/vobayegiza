"Not even talkin' to Nicki, communication is breakin,'" he rapped, via&nbsp;<a href=#>Genius</a>. Minaj revealed she was upset that Drake did not include her, or any Young Money alumni, on his latest album. "I'm Young Money 'til the death of me," she said in a 2013 interview with&nbsp;DJ Whoo Kid, via <a href=#>BET</a>. "I'm always going to want my team to be a part of my project, no matter what, in some way." The pair made up but hit another roadblock in 2015 when Drake began feuding with Minaj's then-boyfriend Meek Mill.</p><p dir=ltr>Meek Mill began the beef, <a href=#>tweeting</a> that Drake didn't write his own raps. In a <a href=#>follow-up</a>, he claimed that had he known Drake didn't write his verse on their collab track "R.I.C.O.," Meek Mill would have taken it off the album. Drake responded by releasing two diss tracks, <a href=#>"Charged Up"</a> and <a href=#>"Back to Back."</a> In "Charged Up," Drake implies he hooked up with Minaj, while in "Back to Back," he claimed Meek Mill's relationship with Minaj wouldn't last. "Make sure you hit him with the prenup," he rapped, "then tell that man to ease up."</p><p>Minaj tried to stay out of the drama, telling <a href=#>The New York Times</a>, "You don't ever want to choose sides between people you love. It's ridiculous. I just want it to be over."</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7r7XCpKCsr5mbwW%2BvzqZmb2hpaH55e8CrnGacopa4pnnAp5tmppmYuKp5zKKlmqJdqMGquMtmmqWno5p8</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
