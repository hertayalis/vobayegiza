To help celebrate the event, Bungie is bringing back the Tributary Emblem for the “Iron Banana.” I’m a fan of collecting myself and appreciate a good emblem as much as the next person, so I put together a guide that’ll go over how to unlock the Tributary Emblem in Destiny 2.</p><p><strong>Related:</strong> <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Destiny 2 Ragnhild-D God Roll Guide – PvP and PvE</a></p><h2>How To Unlock the Tributary Emblem in Destiny 2?</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.gamepur.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/Iron-Banner-Daily-Challenges-in-Destiny-2.jpg><p>Unlocking banners <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">during the Iron Banner event</a> is quite simple in theory but hard in practice. <strong>The first goal is to qualify for the Iron Banner by completing the qualification matches beforehand</strong>. For new players, <strong>you’ll first want to complete the new light quests until you reach the point where you can speak to Lord Shaxx</strong>. This quest step should become available after you gain access to the Tower on Earth. Once you get to the Tower, speak to Lord Saladin in the Tower Courtyard, then open your director to complete your placement matches.</p><p data-injection=true>Once you’ve completed your placement, you’ll be assigned a rank. All this does is match you up with players around your skill level. You’ll want to continue participating in Iron Banner PvP matches and <strong>winning to earn more points to rank up faster</strong>. As for unlocking emblems, you must complete specific objectives as you play your matches.</p><p><strong>Related:</strong> <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Destiny 2 Server Status – is Destiny 2 Down?</a></p><p>To give you an example of an emblem I’ve unlocked <strong>while going after “The Golden Standard” emblem, I completed the “One Fell Swoop” triumph, which had me land final blows on the entire enemy team before any of them respawned</strong>. You can complete that one as well, along with triumphs such as <strong>“Seven Deadly,” “Warlord,” “Fifth Horseman,” “Iron Legend,” “Usurper,” and “Ghost Wolf</strong>.” When the Tributary is released on <strong>December 5</strong>, there will most likely be a similar objective that’ll have to be completed to be given the emblem. In the meantime, polish your PvP skills by <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">participating in the Crucible</a> as soon as possible.</p><h3>About the author</h3><img alt src="https://cdn.statically.io/img/secure.gravatar.com/avatar/fb78933cb855d4960b020ab3969ca367?s=192&d=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.gamepur.com%2Fwp-content%2Fuploads%2F2020%2F01%2Fcropped-gamepur_favicon-1-192x192.png&r=g2x" height=96 width=96 decoding=async style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><h3>Raymond Dyer</h3><p class=author-url><a href=#>http://Gamepur.com</a></p><p class=author-desc>Raymond Dyer is a longtime gamer and writer, not necessarily in that order.
