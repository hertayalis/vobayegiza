In March 2022, Jones was seen in Arizona,&nbsp;at Beau's place.</p><p>This made many fans question if the two were together and dating once again. So Jones took to her <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">podcast</a>,&nbsp;What They Don't Tell You, to clarify the situation&nbsp;on March 8, 2022. <span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-612 class=ezoic-adpicker-ad></span></p><p>She explained she was not together with her ex, but was there to take care of their dog, Rarri.&nbsp;The two used to share Rarri when they were dating. <span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-616 class=ezoic-adpicker-ad></span></p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-ad ezoic-long_content"></span><p></p><p><strong>Jordyn Jones and Jordan Beau posing for a picture. </strong>(Source: <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">Instagram</a>)</p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-ad ezoic-longer_content"></span><p>But after they parted ways, Rarri stayed with Beau.

He explained he was going away for nine days and needed someone to care for his dog.&nbsp;</p><p>Jones gladly took up the offer, but said she could not be with Rarri for nine days. This was because she had her birthday, podcast, and other businesses to look after.&nbsp;</p><p>Beau did not want Rarri to stay in L.A. but wanted Jones to go to Arizona. The latter agreed and promised to look after his dog for five days.&nbsp;</p><p>Beau had already left his home before Jones, and her friend, Sophia, arrived at his home. She clarified she was not back with her ex boyfriend, but everything was purely platonic.&nbsp; <span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-173 class=ezoic-adpicker-ad></span></p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-ad ezoic-longest_content"></span><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-ad ezoic-incontent_5"></span><h2>Who Is Jordyn Jones Dating Now?</h2><p>After her breakup with Beau, many speculated that Jones had moved on with&nbsp;Zach&nbsp;Clayton.
