My answer was “more than you could imagine.” I just can’t get the recipes out fast enough to you! This has been my thing for as long as I can remember so I have collected and created an incredible amount of recipes over the years.</p><p>This 100K Malted Milk Chocolate Chip Cookie recipe has been a staple in my cookbook for almost 20 years. &nbsp;My cousin’s wife brought these cookies in a large basket to a family gathering and I knew that I had to have the recipe. The ingredients are so unique! I have been playing around and tweaking this recipe for years and it is downright amazing.</p><p><img decoding=async src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.modernhoney.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/06/DSC_0832-copy.jpg alt="100K Malted Milk Chocolate Chip Cookies.

Martha Stewart is known to eat it straight from the can in her refrigerator and I have never related to her more than I do now.</p><p>The sweetened condensed milk creates that chewy, melt-in-your-mouth texture. If you want to know what to do with the remaining sweetened condensed milk, <a href=#>make this soft, buttery caramel corn recipe</a>.</p><p>My favorite milk chocolate chips to use in these cookies are Guittard, Ghirardelli, and Trader Joe’s Milk Chocolate Pound Plus Bar. I love to use both chips and chunks for variation in these 100K Malted Milk Chocolate Chip Cookies plus the chocolate bar gets all melty and fabulous.</p><p><img decoding=async src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.modernhoney.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/06/DSC_0854-copy.jpg alt="100K Malted Milk Chocolate Chip Cookies.
