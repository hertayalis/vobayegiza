Overall, a huge part of his content is inconveniencing other people while <a href=# rel class="font-semibold hover:text-accent-color border-b-2 border-accent-color">marching around with a security guard.</a> If the person he antagonizes tries to do anything to him, the security guard steps in. Although this has made him famous, internet users have asked: "at what cost?"

A clip was making the rounds in which he casually said the word using the hard "ER." Overall, fans were pretty shocked by it, especially since Doherty didn't even seem fazed. Well, last night, Doherty was in the airport, and with some free time on his hands, he decided to address the controversy. However, he did so in the worst way possible. Firstly, he denied using the word, claiming he actually said "hater." Meanwhile, he called his fans an ableist slur that we prefer not to use in this article.</p><span></span><p class="__className_619da4 text-dark-grey !leading-[1.9125rem] break-words text-[17px] lg:text-lg">Doherty is still a young man so he is bound to make mistakes. However, as a child of the internet, one would expect him to have better instincts about this kind of stuff. By now, you should know not to openly use slurs, all while saying them with your chest. It's a bad look, and with Kick refusing to ban people for such offenses, he will likely continue this behavior unchecked.</p><p class="__className_619da4 text-dark-grey !leading-[1.9125rem] break-words text-[17px] lg:text-lg">Let us know what you think of Jack Doherty and his antics, in the comments section down below.
