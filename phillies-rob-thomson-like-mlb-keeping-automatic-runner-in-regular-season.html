There is no automatic runner in the postseason.
“During the playoffs, I don’t [like it],” the former Yankees bench coach said. “I think you play baseball.”
But during the grueling regular season, with players now only allowed to be optioned to the minor leagues five times per year and pitchers forced to stay in the minors for 15 days, the rule makes sense, since it helps prevent games that stretch on for 17 or 18 innings."><link rel=stylesheet href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/cayman/css/normalize.css><link href="https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans:400,700" rel=stylesheet type=text/css><link rel=stylesheet href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/cayman/css/cayman.css><link rel=apple-touch-icon sizes=180x180 href=./apple-touch-icon.png><link rel=icon type=image/png sizes=32x32 href=./favicon-32x32.png><link rel=icon type=image/png sizes=16x16 href=./favicon-16x16.png><link rel=stylesheet href=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/katex@0.10.2/dist/katex.min.css integrity=sha384-yFRtMMDnQtDRO8rLpMIKrtPCD5jdktao2TV19YiZYWMDkUR5GQZR/NOVTdquEx1j crossorigin=anonymous><script defer src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/katex@0.10.2/dist/katex.min.js integrity=sha384-9Nhn55MVVN0/4OFx7EE5kpFBPsEMZxKTCnA+4fqDmg12eCTqGi6+BB2LjY8brQxJ crossorigin=anonymous></script>

It’s been an evolution throughout the course of the year.”</p><p>Another former Met, Justin Turner, won the Roberto Clemente Award for his charitable work in the Los Angeles area with the Dodgers. The award annually goes to the player “who best represents … baseball through extraordinary character, community involvement, philanthropy, and positive contributions, both on and off the field.”</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmimqaW8tMCNnKamZ2Jlf3N7kGlmbGlfpbWquMuinKxloqSvbsDHqKSsp55iuaq3xGakpZpdoLKmvMinnmaZpam8rq3ToppmqqWju6a%2BjKKlZqqVnMKtrdFmqp6Zo6S7cA%3D%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
