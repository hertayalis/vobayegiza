But when Jax says in the May 21 episode that he and Brittany "don't believe in divorce," it drums up plenty of questions about how they move forward if divorce is totally off the table. And it also makes you wonder why Jax and Brittany don't believe in divorce exactly.</p><p>Outside of The Valley, Jax and Brittany have been public about their separation. And although they're co-parenting their son Cruz and still hosting a weekly podcast together, Jax and Brittany aren't romantically together right now. In fact, in a recent episode of their podcast When Reality Hits, Jax told Brittany she is free to date whoever she wants for the time being. Clearly, there's a lot about their marriage and their separation that people don't quite understand.</p><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><span>Source: Casey Durkin/Bravo</span></figure><h2 data-header=true class="sc-bTJPMs hHQrGE">Why don't Jax and Brittany believe in divorce on 'The Valley'?</h2><p>Prior to the May 21 episode of the Bravo series, Jax brought up how divorce isn't something he and Brittany are considering.</p><p>"That 'D-word' does not exist in my family," he said on The Valley. "We don't do that."</p><p>Now, he's doubling down on that sentiment, and it might be because Jax was raised Catholic. And when he and Brittany got married, Jax married into a family whose faith is important to them as well. It's possible that Jax doesn't see divorce as an option because of his and Brittany’s religious beliefs.</p><figure class="sc-bYwzba cYmwOA"><a href=# style=background:#fff;line-height:0;padding:0;text-align:center;text-decoration:none;width:100%>View this post on Instagram</a><p style="color:#c9c8cd;font-family:Arial,sans-serif;font-size:14px;line-height:17px;margin-bottom:0;margin-top:8px;overflow:hidden;padding:8px 0 7px;text-align:center;text-overflow:ellipsis;white-space:nowrap"><a href=# style=color:#c9c8cd;font-family:Arial,sans-serif;font-size:14px;font-style:normal;font-weight:400;line-height:17px;text-decoration:none>A post shared by Jax (@mrjaxtaylor)</a></p></figure><p>The couple has also spoken out about rumors that claim their separation is fake, and part of a storyline to drum up interest in The Valley. There's no denying that the timing was a bit suspect, at least from some fans' points of view. However, according to the couple, their separation is anything but fabricated.</p><p>"I felt like, 'Why would anybody think that I would do that?' Especially with my son, you know? I would never put him through that for no reason, for a fake stunt," Brittany said on Watch What Happens Live, when asked about the rumors that the split is a publicity stunt for The Valley. "That doesn't make any sense."</p><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Source: Instagram/@brittany</a></figure><h2 data-header=true class="sc-bTJPMs hHQrGE">Are Jax and Brittany still separated?</h2><p>As of May 2024, it looks like Jax and Brittany are still separated. They shared in a recent episode of their podcast that they hadn't hugged or kissed in quite some time. So even if divorce is still off the table, Jax and Brittany's separation is still very real.</p><p>Jax and Brittany originally separated due to many reasons, including a lack of communication and lack of intimacy. They continue to be there for their son together, and even participate in family events for the sake of Cruz. But Jax and Brittany haven't yet mended things, even if they aren't divorced either.</p><p>Watch The Valley on Tuesdays at 9 p.m. EST on Bravo.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7pbXSramam6Ses7p6wqikaKhfrLW6ecOopa1lmpbFbq3NnWSbqpmpwaK62GaZnqSZmsOmecinZJ2hpqS%2FpLGMrZ%2BeZaaWua2x2A%3D%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
