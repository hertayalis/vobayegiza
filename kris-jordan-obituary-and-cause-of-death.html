Kris has been a friend of mine since the early 90s. Together we created the first Teenage Republican Club in Delaware County, and he was the first president. Through the years, we have given one another political advice, been friends, and always talked on a regular basis. He truly cared about the cause of liberty and promoted small government policies as a county commissioner, State Senator and State Representative. His death is a great loss to our county’s Republican Party, the Ohio Statehouse and the conservative movement. My wife, Sara Marie, and I extend our sincere condolences to his parents – whom I have known for almost 30 years, his three children, and his ex-wife. We will be keeping them all in our prayers, and we encourage everyone to support them during this difficult time.”</span></span></p><h2>How Old Was Kris Jordan?&nbsp;</h2><p>Kris Jordan was 46 years old at the time of his death.
