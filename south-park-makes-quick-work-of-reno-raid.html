They’ve killed Kenny – and possibly made history, producing a “South Park” episode on the Elian Gonzalez story almost as fast as the raid to seize the boy.
 In last night’s ripped-from-the headlines episode of the raunchy Comedy Central cartoon, “South Park” producers spoofed the case – right up to last weekend’s controversial raid on the Miami home of the boy’s relatives.
 The show was done from scratch in four days that included two all-nighters, its producers said yesterday."><link rel=stylesheet href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/cayman/css/normalize.css><link href="https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans:400,700" rel=stylesheet type=text/css><link rel=stylesheet href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/cayman/css/cayman.css><link rel=apple-touch-icon sizes=180x180 href=./apple-touch-icon.png><link rel=icon type=image/png sizes=32x32 href=./favicon-32x32.png><link rel=icon type=image/png sizes=16x16 href=./favicon-16x16.png><link rel=stylesheet href=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/katex@0.10.2/dist/katex.min.css integrity=sha384-yFRtMMDnQtDRO8rLpMIKrtPCD5jdktao2TV19YiZYWMDkUR5GQZR/NOVTdquEx1j crossorigin=anonymous><script defer src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/katex@0.10.2/dist/katex.min.js integrity=sha384-9Nhn55MVVN0/4OFx7EE5kpFBPsEMZxKTCnA+4fqDmg12eCTqGi6+BB2LjY8brQxJ crossorigin=anonymous></script>

Most animated TV shows, such as “The Simpsons,” take months to create.</p><p>But using computers similar to those used to animated the dinosaurs in “Jurassic Park,” “South Park” creators Trey Parker and Matt Stone, along with a team of 70 animators, computer engineers and actors, have devised a technique that allows them to build an episode in less than a week.</p><p>“South Park” follows the adventures of four foul-mouthed fourth graders (Stan, Kyle, Kenny and Cartman).</p><p>In Wednesday’s episode, Romanian quintuplets defect after performing in a visiting French-Canadian circus.
