That brings to mind the age-old question, of whether newer is automatically better."><link rel=stylesheet href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/cayman/css/normalize.css><link href="https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans:400,700" rel=stylesheet type=text/css><link rel=stylesheet href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/cayman/css/cayman.css><link rel=apple-touch-icon sizes=180x180 href=./apple-touch-icon.png><link rel=icon type=image/png sizes=32x32 href=./favicon-32x32.png><link rel=icon type=image/png sizes=16x16 href=./favicon-16x16.png><link rel=stylesheet href=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/katex@0.10.2/dist/katex.min.css integrity=sha384-yFRtMMDnQtDRO8rLpMIKrtPCD5jdktao2TV19YiZYWMDkUR5GQZR/NOVTdquEx1j crossorigin=anonymous><script defer src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/katex@0.10.2/dist/katex.min.js integrity=sha384-9Nhn55MVVN0/4OFx7EE5kpFBPsEMZxKTCnA+4fqDmg12eCTqGi6+BB2LjY8brQxJ crossorigin=anonymous></script>

But for anyone considering an upgrade to a Surface device at around that $800 price, the Surface Pro 7+ still presents an attractive purchase, and it can flip into a tablet when you need it.</p><p>That brings to mind the age-old question, of whether newer is automatically better. In this case, it might not be. Let’s take a look at the Surface Laptop Go 3 versus Surface Pro 7+, to find out.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.digitaltrends.com/data:image/gif;base64><h2>Availability and pricing</h2><p>The <a href=#>Surface Pro 7+ was initially released in 2021</a> as a business-focused refresh of the original Pro 7 at a base price of $800. It featured various next-generation CPUs, better battery life, and the option of more memory. However, higher-end configurations were much more expensive, costing over $2,000 for the very top model. Today it’s almost impossible to find, especially in the base configuration — though some Business models are still available through the Microsoft store. Availability is unlikely to improve.</p><p>The Surface Laptop Go 3 was announced at <a href=#>Microsoft’s September 2023 event</a>&nbsp;and&nbsp;is available for preorder now. It will officially ship out to customers and go on sale, on October 3. Its base model has an Intel Core i5-1235U, 8GB of <a href=# data-injected=1>RAM</a>, and a 256GB SSD for $800. You can upgrade to 16GB of RAM for $1,000.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src><h2>Specs</h2><table class=styled><tbody><tr><td></td><td><strong>Surface Laptop Go 3</strong></td><td><strong>Surface Pro 7+</strong></td></tr><tr><td><strong>CPU</strong></td><td>Intel Core i5-1235U</td><td>Intel Core i3-1115G4, Core i5-1135G7, Core i7-1165G7</td></tr><tr><td><strong>RAM</strong></td><td>8GB, 16GB</td><td>8GB, 16GB, 32GB</td></tr><tr><td><strong>Graphics</strong></td><td>Intel Iris Xe</td><td>Intel UHD, Intel Iris Xe</td></tr><tr><td><strong>Storage</strong></td><td>256GB SSD</td><td>128GB, 256GB, 512GB, 1TB SSD</td></tr><tr><td><strong>Display</strong></td><td>12.4-inch touchscreen, 1536 x 1024</td><td>12.3-inch touchscreen, 2736 x 1824</td></tr><tr><td><strong>Ports</strong></td><td>USB-C, USB-A, headphone jack, Surface Connect</td><td>USB-C, USB-A, headphone jack, Surface Connect, MicroSDXC card reader</td></tr><tr><td><strong>Battery life</strong></td><td>15 hours</td><td>15 hours</td></tr></tbody></table><p>With several years between the release of these two devices, it’s no surprise that their specifications look quite different. The Surface Laptop Go 3 features more modern hardware, with a much more impressive processor, with more cores and better performance in single and multi-threaded workloads. Memory options are similar across both devices, though business buyers have the choice of 32GB with the Pro 7+ if they wish.</p><p>The Pro 7+ also holds a big advantage in storage size. While the Surface Laptop Go 3 does have a removable SSD, it is limited to a mere 256GB which is rather small by 2023 standards. You can swap it out or augment it with an external drive, but the Pro 7+ can have as much as a terabyte of storage right out of the box.</p><p>Both devices have touchscreen displays, but the Surface Pro 7’s is vastly more detailed with a much higher resolution. It’s also designed to work like a tablet and can be folded flat as part of its 2-in-1 convertibility. The Surface Laptop Go 3 does support touch inputs, but can’t fold out into a dedicated tablet device.</p><p>Both <a href=# data-injected=1>laptops</a> have strong battery life, lasting up to 15 hours between charges.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src><h2>Design</h2><p>The Surface Laptop Pro 7+ was an excellent 2-in-1 laptop in its day, offering strong performance, long battery life, and a very detailed touchscreen. It’s a lightweight device too at just 1.7 pounds,&nbsp; and with a detachable keyboard, it’s even more lightweight and functional when held in one hand as a tablet. It also offers good support for the Surface Pen, although there’s no slot for charging it like there is in later Surface Pro models.</p><p>The Surface Laptop Go 3 is a newer device, and its design looks like it. It comes in a range of colors and features much slimmer bezels. It can only function as a clamshell laptop, though, even with its touchscreen. While it’s still lightweight at just over two pounds, it’s almost 50% heavier than the Surface Pro 7+, making it a little less portable.</p><p>Port selection is almost identical between the two, with a distinct lack of <a href=# data-injected=1>Thunderbolt</a> support on the more modern Laptop Go 3. Both come equipped with <a href=# data-injected=1>Windows 11</a>, though it’s likely the Surface Laptop Go 3 will come with a more recent build, requiring less immediate updating. The Pro 7+ has a higher resolution 1080p webcam, versus the 720p model in the Laptop Go 3.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src><h2>Performance</h2><p>Chip for chip, the Surface Laptop Go 3 has an advantage. Its more modern Intel Core i5-1235U CPU has 10 cores (2P/8E), with support for 12 simultaneous threads. In comparison, the absolute best, highest-end Surface Pro 7+ CPU, the Core i7-1165G7 has just four cores, with support for eight simultaneous threads. Due to the higher clock speed of the Core i7, it claws back a bit of performance, but ultimately the newer Laptop Go 3 should be faster.</p><p>That’s faster than the top Pro 7+ model, too. With its price tag that’s more than two times that of the Laptop Go 3.</p><p>However, the CPU isn’t the whole story. With just 8GB of RAM, there will be some more demanding tasks that the base model Laptop Go 3 struggles with. Upgrading to 16GB should alleviate that and expand its ability to multi-task, likely making it faster than just about any configuration of the Surface Pro 7+. The Business model with 32GB of RAM might hold some advantages in specific memory-intensive tasks, but that older 11th-gen CPU just won’t be able to keep up with most tasks.</p><p>With storage there is an advantage with the Pro 7+, but again only if you’re willing to pay for it. It would be a&nbsp;lot cheaper to buy the base model Surface Laptop Go 3 and attach a fast external SSD if you need more space. It won’t be as fast, but it won’t be that much slower, either.</p><h2>Buying newer is still better</h2><p>As much as the Surface Pro 7+ might still hold a few advantages over the Surface Laptop Go 3, it’s hard to recommend a more than two-year-old refresh of a three-year-old device, over something brand new. The webcam in the Laptop Go 3 is lower resolution, and it’s heavier, and it can’t convert into a tablet. But it’s faster than even the fastest Pro 7+ and is much cheaper. In some cases less than half the price.</p><p>If you particularly need a tablet and a laptop in one, then the Pro 7+ might be better — but in that case, you should look at our <a href=#>favorite 2-in-1s instead</a>. For anyone else, a Surface Laptop Go 3 is going to be better. It performs better, looks far more modern, and will offer much greater longevity.</p><p>Intrigued by what a bigger budget might get you?
