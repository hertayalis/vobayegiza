The 456 participants compete in a series of children’s games whose ultimate winner gets a life-changing sum of money, $38 million. However, the catch is that if you lose, you die.</p><p data-characters=113 data-current-count=474 data-injectable=true>Now it seems South Korea itself may have more unsavory parallels to the show than western audiences may realize.</p><p data-characters=316 data-current-count=316 data-injectable=false>According to a report from <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">LA Times</a>, the country is grappling with an underground world of illegal private lending that tempts South Korean citizens — especially business owners — into predatory agreements, complete with business card-toting henchmen on motorcycles who pass out the ads to people in desperation.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wegotthiscovered.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/5bu7qtxal1t71.jpg><p data-characters=168 data-current-count=484 data-injectable=true>These lenders trap their clients with crippling interest rates, domineering collection methods, and the beginning of what is sometimes a steep slide into further debt.</p><p data-characters=517 data-current-count=517 data-injectable=true>Park Chui-woo was one such, real-life victim, who found himself maxed out on all lines of credit and facing a payday for the employees of his tiny chain of coffee shops. Upon calling the number from a business card dropped at his feet from a motorcyclist, he was greeted to “motorcycle-riding, tatted-up skinheads” to talk terms with Park, the report said. That included dropping off a wad of cash, from which they would stop at his store daily to collect the interest at an annualized rate of about 210%.</p><p data-characters=571 data-current-count=571 data-injectable=true>According to government regulators, there were about 300,000 reports of illegal lending advertisements in 2020, a 30% increase from the year before. What’s more, South Koreans’ average household debt rose to record levels in the second quarter of 2021, jumping more than 10% compared to the previous year. The Bank of Korea said people in their 30s are the most heavily burdened, having borrowed an average of more than 260% of their income. The exorbitant interest eventually led Park to have to borrow even more money from the loan sharks over three years.</p><p data-characters=70 data-current-count=70 data-injectable=false>Do you think<strong> Squid Game</strong> parallels anything about life here in America?</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivlZy8tcDHoqqcp6aav6awjZympmekq3y0u9Stn2ajn6eyor%2BMrKiuoZRitKK5xGanmqqRobmmuNJmmqitnqm%2Fur%2BMq5yapF2htqexjKWmmqZdqLWivspmp6unkqGyrns%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
