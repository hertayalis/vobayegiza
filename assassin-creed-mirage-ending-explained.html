Tragically, the heist goes awry, resulting in Nehal inadvertently killing the Caliph.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading><strong>A Twisted Path of Destiny</strong></h2><p>Following this incident, Basim gains admission to the Hidden Ones, establishing a connection with his mentor, Roshan. Yet, his visions intensify, propelling him down a path to seek answers further.</p><p>Encouraged by Nehal, Basim becomes drawn to the Order of the Ancients, a recurring group of antagonists in the Assassin’s Creed series, who eventually evolve into the Templar Order.</p><p>He embarks on a relentless mission to eliminate its members, leading him to an ancient concealed temple beneath Alamut, an area that extends beyond AC Mirage’s main map set in Baghdad.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading><strong>The Rise of Roshan as the Ultimate Adversary</strong></h2><p>Basim’s departure from the Hidden Ones’ intended path sparks disapproval from his mentor, Roshan, who subsequently evolves into the final boss in <a href=# data-type=post_tag data-id=364>Assassin’s Creed Mirage</a>.</p><p>The game continually hints at the mysterious presence of Qabiha, whom Basim perceives as his adversary. When Basim confronts her, Qabiha astonishingly reveals her extensive knowledge of him, asserting that he is more than merely human. She encourages him to pursue his quest for the truth.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/peepswiz.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/Assassins-Creed-Mirage-Ending-Explained-1024x576.jpg><p>Unexpectedly, Roshan intervenes, assassinating Qabiha, and confronts Basim, demanding that he relinquish his chosen path and return to the Brotherhood. She threatens to take Basim’s life should he refuse.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading><strong>The Culmination of a Heroic Journey</strong></h2><p>Basim’s resolve remains unshaken as he ventures into Alamut to reach the temple’s entrance, fiercely contested by members of both the Order of the Ancients and the Hidden Ones.</p><p>His final showdown with Roshan unfolds before the temple’s threshold. Roshan believes that the Hidden Ones should be unified without distinction, compelling Basim to pass through her as the ultimate test.</p><p>Roshan, agile and equipped with projectile weapons, tests Basim’s agility, urging players to deflect her projectiles and seize opportunities to strike.</p><p>Ultimately, Roshan falls to Basim’s hidden blade, leaving her fate in his hands. Basim, intent on personal growth and autonomy, chooses to spare Roshan. Alongside Nehal, they open the temple doors, embarking on the next chapter of their journey.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading><strong>Revelations in the Ancient Temple</strong></h2><p>As Basim and Nehal traverse the ancient temple’s inner chambers, they confront the architecture, prompting Basim to ponder its origins and mysteries.</p><p>Nehal exhibits a profound understanding of the temple but remains unable to explain it fully. Together, they encounter the central chamber, a place familiar to Basim from his visions. Inside, they discover a coffin-like structure.</p><p>Basim’s momentous discovery inside the coffin shakes the foundations of his understanding. To his astonishment, he encounters a living Nehal.</p><p>He pieces together that the Nehal he knew was a mere manifestation of an imprisoned ancient being from the advanced human civilization that constructed the temple. Now, Basim experiences a series of scenes in a surreal, otherworldly dimension.</p><p>As he watches, elements from his genetic memory come to light. Further exploration reveals memories of imprisonment and darkness, which he vividly recalls. His journey culminates as he approaches the cell he remembers.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading><strong>The Final Confrontation with the Jinni</strong></h2><p>In this cell, Basim encounters the jinni from his relentless visions, and a direct exchange unfolds. Basim realizes that the jinni is but a manifestation of a traumatic memory from a past life.</p><p>His acknowledgment serves as the catalyst for the jinni’s dissolution into dust, symbolizing the end of Basim’s internal turmoil.</p><p>However, Nehal challenges the notion that this marks the conclusion, instead heralding it as a new beginning. The merging of Basim and Nehal ensues, with Basim assimilating their memories and experiences.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading><strong>A Returning Hero and Unresolved Ties</strong></h2><p>Emerging from the temple, Basim’s return to Baghdad signals a transformative shift within the Hidden Ones. Roshan, unable to accept the divergence from tradition, resigns from the organization.</p><p>The narrative concludes, but the path of Basim may not be fully traversed. Crossover missions connecting Mirage and Valhalla involve Basim sharing his DNA with modern-day Assassins, hinting at further adventures.</p><p>Mirage and Valhalla are intricately entwined, with Basim’s revelation as the shape-shifting god Loki and Eivor’s role as Odin’s reincarnation.</p><p>The epilogue alludes to Basim’s quest for revenge, bridging the journey to Ravensthorpe. Here, Basim gains Eivor’s trust, setting the stage for their impending confrontation.</p><p>The thrilling story of Assassin’s Creed Mirage comes to a thrilling conclusion, and the prospect of sequels or downloadable content (DLC) opens up exciting opportunities to explore Basim’s untold adventures in greater detail.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiolZq9tMPIs2Wcp51kwbd7wKyqmqujnrtur9GenJ1lnZ6%2ForPEZpynnJmjtG6x16mjmqGemrFw</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
