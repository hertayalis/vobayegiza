But when Joy-Anna Duggar Forsyth announced the birth of her baby girl with husband Austin Forsyth, everyone still wanted to know the name they had chosen. In the Duggar family, when babies are a fact of life and not exactly a surprise, the one unique thing fans can look forward to is what each adult Duggar kid and their spouse choose to name their child."><link rel=stylesheet href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/cayman/css/normalize.css><link href="https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans:400,700" rel=stylesheet type=text/css><link rel=stylesheet href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/cayman/css/cayman.css><link rel=apple-touch-icon sizes=180x180 href=./apple-touch-icon.png><link rel=icon type=image/png sizes=32x32 href=./favicon-32x32.png><link rel=icon type=image/png sizes=16x16 href=./favicon-16x16.png><link rel=stylesheet href=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/katex@0.10.2/dist/katex.min.css integrity=sha384-yFRtMMDnQtDRO8rLpMIKrtPCD5jdktao2TV19YiZYWMDkUR5GQZR/NOVTdquEx1j crossorigin=anonymous><script defer src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/katex@0.10.2/dist/katex.min.js integrity=sha384-9Nhn55MVVN0/4OFx7EE5kpFBPsEMZxKTCnA+4fqDmg12eCTqGi6+BB2LjY8brQxJ crossorigin=anonymous></script>

One Redditor pointed out that in one of Joy-Anna's Instagram stories, she added a 'just peachy' sticker to a photo of herself and Austin with their new baby. The Redditor theorized it could be a clue that <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer"><u>they named her Georgia</u></a>, as in Georgia peaches.</p><p>Someone pointed out that there is a town by the name of Forsyth in Georgia. And using that name would carry on a "G" letter theme, if that's the plan after their firstborn, Gideon. Given that Joy-Anna's daughter's name is actually Evelyn, however, the "G" theme has effectively been debunked.</p><figure class="sc-bYwzba cYmwOA"><a href=# style=background:#fff;line-height:0;padding:0;text-align:center;text-decoration:none;width:100%>View this post on Instagram</a><p style="margin:8px 0 0;padding:0 4px"><a href=# style=color:#000;font-family:Arial,sans-serif;font-size:14px;font-style:normal;font-weight:400;line-height:17px;text-decoration:none;word-wrap:break-word>25 weeks!üíù .

Besides Anna and Josh using "M" names, Josiah and Lauren Duggar explained at their baby shower for their daughter Bella that they planned to use a naming theme as well.</p><p>After losing Lauren's first pregnancy early on with a baby who would have been named Asa, they planned to go alphabetically, meaning their next child's name should start with a "C." The jury is still out on what the other adult Duggar siblings plan to do for more baby names, but Joy-Anna and Austin likely have one picked that they are still holding close to their chests.</p><p>Watch Counting On on Tuesdays at 9 p.m. ET on TLC.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7pbXSramam6Ses7p6wqikaKhfn7y6ecCnpZpllKq0qK3RZpmamqlitKq%2By2almqWV</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. ¬© 2022.
