Anytime I walk anywhere, I got my gun in my hand, walking wherever in Jacksonville, that's just how you gotta be," said Foolio. "As soon as I get to sit down a little bit, n***as get to blowin', pop, pop, pop, pop. I just see two n***as shootin'. I had located where the shots were comin' from, like, 'What the f*ck going on!? I'm dead, I know I'm dead.' These n***as blowin'. So I leaned back, upped my gun and get to shootin' back. I shoot my whole clip and sh*t. Them n***as dropped they clip at the scene, all type of sh*t. I thought I popped one of them b*tch ass n***as. I saw the car pull off. When I hopped out the car, I had one slide on and I'm running back up to the studio. I run up to the studio like, 'Boy, you set me up!' He's like, 'Hell nah!' He showed me his messages, like, 'I swear to God, on my mom!'"</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/urbanlinx.wpengine.com/wp-content/uploads/userfiles/80/26/982680_1e40d8c40e6019d9c4595743061747e6.png><p>Foolio went on to state that he had three guns with him at the time of the shooting-- two on his person and another in the trunk of the car.&nbsp;</p><p>During the same interview, Foolio also spoke about his diss track back-and-forth with Yungeen Ace, explaining how he felt after "Who I Smoke" dropped and&nbsp;<a href=# rel>before he released "When I See You."</a></p><p>"I ain't no hater, the song went crazy!" he said about Spinabenz and Yungeen Ace's viral hit. "I'm mad as f*ck. That was going crazy! I was like, 'Damn, what can I do?' I go to Miami, I was already going through my comments and they were hitting me with a bunch of songs to remix. They sent <a href=# class=text-word rel>Miley Cyrus</a> 'Party In The USA,' imagine me rapping on that sh*t! They said Michael Jackson 'Beat It'. They sent all types of sh*t but what stood out to me was 'When I See You' [by <a href=# class=text-word rel>Fantasia</a>]. Did that song, I first listened to it in the studio like, 'Damn, these n***as finna be mad.' So I get back to Jacksonville, I go get a poster printed out of the news clip with [Ace's] dead homeboys on the sh*t, I get two bottles of cheap ass champagne, I go to the graveyard, I shoot the video, I dropped that b*tch."</p><p>Answering whether he thinks he went too far, Foolio said, "Hell nah. Once dead people get mentioned, it's already too far."</p><p>Watch a few clips from Foolio's interview with DJ Akademiks below, as well as the two diss tracks mentioned.</p><p></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7qbvTp5ywoJmltbC8jZympmdkZYZ2fZZmnainnJ68br7EnJilpKNirrS%2FwKyqoqaRqbawuoyaq62dnaXBbr%2FAsqpmsaWjtKaxzWaYnJ2jYsSpu4yiZKyln6CybsPEp6tmm6KWx7p5zZ6urA%3D%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
