Though she admitted that she took dieting and working out too hard when she was younger, she now feels much more accepting and confident of her body. But it doesn’t mean that she doesn’t stick to healthy habits anymore because she still does. It’s crucial not only for the weight thing but for her general well-being. Talking about how she keeps herself fit and healthy, she said:</p><p>“When I was in my 20s I used to go crazy. I used to work out two or three hours a day like cycling, I was never anorexic, just picky. When I was in my 30s I’d go back and forth, now that I’m 41 I’m like whatever man! For the most part, I just do a regular workout. I have a trainer and that’s about it!”</p><span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-910 data-method=placement-service></span><h3 class=related_post_title>Related Posts</h3><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-video ezoic-longer_content"></span><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7pLHLnpmroaSuwKrGxKxlnKedZLe2v9OipZplnZawqa3DqGSwp6KgvLbAjKumrqyZo7Jw</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
