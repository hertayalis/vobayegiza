Her portrayal of El, the badass hero with extraordinary powers in&nbsp;Stranger Things&nbsp;– the cult Netflix sci-fi series set in 1980s Hawkins, Indiana – landed her several Emmy nominations, making her one of the youngest in Emmy history.</p><p class="paragraph___RlNzb paragraph-paragraph10___NmvOh value___Lxa4N">The British actress was born in Spain to English parents, and lived in England and Orlando before moving to Los Angeles, teaching herself the American accent by watching the Disney channel. No stranger to the screen, Brown had roles in TV-series including&nbsp;Intruders&nbsp;and&nbsp;Once Upon A Time In Wonderland, along with guest appearances on&nbsp;Grey’s Anatomy,&nbsp;Modern Family&nbsp;and&nbsp;NCIS, before her breakthrough.</p><p class="paragraph___RlNzb paragraph-paragraph10___NmvOh value___Lxa4N">Since exploding on the hugely popular Netflix show (now three seasons in), Brown has carved out a dizzying resume that belies her young age. Coupled with her quirky, instantly likable personality – she broke the internet flossing to the Yodel Kid, showcased her rap prowess spitting both Nicki Minaj and Cardi B, and is BFFs with Drake – she is shy of 30 million followers on Instagram.</p><p class="paragraph___RlNzb paragraph-paragraph10___NmvOh value___Lxa4N">Hot off the heels of saving Hawkins, Brown starred in the music video for Sigma and Birdy’s single “Find Me” in 2016. The following year, 2017, she made her modeling debut, signing with major modeling agency IMG.</p><p class="paragraph___RlNzb paragraph-paragraph10___NmvOh value___Lxa4N">2018 was a busy year for Brown: she was cast as the new face of Calvin Klein, was tapped for the summer campaign of Moncler in 2018, and she also starred in Converse’s “Forever Chuck” campaign, (paving the way for a Converse By You-collab in 2019.) It was also announced that she will star in – and produce – the upcoming film adaptation of&nbsp;Enola Holmes Mysteries. Oh, and she featured in Maroon 5’s “Girls Like You” video. As a result, Time magazine named her as one of the world’s 100 most influential people 2018 – alongside the likes of Rihanna, Prince Harry and Cardi B – making her the youngest to be featured on the list. The same year she was also appointed as the youngest ever UNICEF Goodwill Ambassador.</p><p class="paragraph___RlNzb paragraph-paragraph10___NmvOh value___Lxa4N">In&nbsp;2019 the binge-worthy third season of&nbsp;Stranger Things&nbsp;was released. This year Brown debuted on the big screen in&nbsp;Godzilla: King of the Monsters, with a sequel slated for 2020. She was also announced to star in the film adaptation of the New York Times’ bestseller,&nbsp;The Thing About Jellyfish.</p><p class="paragraph___RlNzb paragraph-paragraph10___NmvOh value___Lxa4N">In between launching her own vegan make-up brand, she also busy developing a new Netflix film together with her older sister, adapting&nbsp;A Time Lost&nbsp;from the original story. The future seems blindingly bright for this fully-fledged entertainer.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7qbXGoaqnp5KesrXFjZympmeklrRwucilo6KdXZe8o67YZpmrp6ejfA%3D%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
