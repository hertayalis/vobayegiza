Depending on your region the new episode may come out in the early hours of Wednesday at most.</p><p data-characters=266 data-current-count=266 data-injectable=false>Although <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Crunchyroll</a> aired the first season, Disney+ has taken the reigns and aired the newly released since season 2, which it continues to do this time around. Season 1 was the longest season, at 24 episodes total, with season 3 being 13 just like season 2. &nbsp;</p><p data-characters=747 data-current-count=1013 data-injectable=false>Tokyo Revengers was originally going to air on Saturdays, but it was moved to Tuesdays instead. A <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">fan made a post on Reddit</a> commenting that it may have been to avoid clashing with an arguably even more popular series, <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Spy x Family, which returns for season 2 on Oct. 7</a>. But most notably, as the Redditor wrote: “whether it was intentional from the studio or not, there’s the fact that episode 5 is gonna be airing…on Bloody. Halloween.” And we all know what happened at an event appropriately titled Bloody Halloween. Fans of the series who are not caught up with Ken Wakui’s manga, surely await to see if the climax of this season’s conflict will be anything like, or go even beyond, the violent incident of Oct. 31, 2005.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivlZy8tcDHoqqcp6aav6awjZympmeRo7ausY6tpqSxn2K%2FpsLEp56eqqNiwKat0qilZmtdm8KtuIyrnKWdkaiybr%2FCoZydrZyaeqK6w2acqaGjpLGmecKorKesXw%3D%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
