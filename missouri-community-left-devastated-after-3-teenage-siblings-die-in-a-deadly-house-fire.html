As of now, more than $ 86,000 has been raised.</p><p><b>Also Read</b>:</p><p>"To lose a house is devastating," the organizer said in the fundraiser's description.</p><p>"To experience the loss of a home to a fire while you're in it with your family barely out of reach is unimaginable. To lose a child is one of the [worst] experiences fathomable. To lose all three at the same time? There. are. no. words," it added.</p><h2 class=split>What did Bella Smythe's teacher say?</h2><p>The tragedy has also impacted the children's school district, which has offered counseling services to students and staff. "Please keep the family in your thoughts and prayers during this extremely difficult time," Marshfield superintendent Mike Henry said Monday, as per a subsequent report from the Springfield News-Leader.</p><p>Shannon Carter, Bella's teacher, told The Marshfield Mail that the reality of losing three students "at once" is devastating.</p><p>"[Bella] brightened my morning with her laugh each day," she said, adding "I’m left speechless as I think about the future of my classroom without her."</p><p>"Ethan, Danny and Bella were so beautiful and we miss them dearly. We know and understand that money isn't going to bring them back," Cole said in an update on Tuesday, November 14.</p><p>&nbsp;"However, it will help equip Carissa and Daniel with the tools and equipment needed to run the marathon ahead of them. A marathon they have not been training to run. You are helping them through this nightmare of a moment in their lives," Cole added.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmillZbEuHrCqKRopZmowLDB0aJknKedosKvtdOyZKWdlql6pbHVmqqtmaSasW6txa2cq2VjYsGmsc2anp5lo56vrbXNoKpmnJmaeqq6jJpknZ2Rmbm6eceorKydXZu2s7E%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
