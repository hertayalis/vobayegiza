There have been calls to boycott the game due to Rowling’s controversial comments on trans people, with many uneasy about her getting a cut as it’s set in her <strong><a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Harry Potter</a></strong>/Wizarding World universe. This has resulted in an ongoing debate about separating the art from the artist. On one hand, people naturally want to support the story that they grew up with as children. On the other, many are all too aware of who their money is going towards.</p>Recommended Videos<p data-characters=360 data-current-count=360 data-injectable=false>Rowling’s books are still big sellers, with first-edition printings&nbsp;<a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">being sold at auction for a high price</a>. But what about the films? All eight movies are available to stream on HBO Max and Netflix, as well as the Fantastic Beasts saga. So while it’s easy to answer if Rowling made money through book sales, what about royalties through the films?</p><h2 id=h-does-j-k-rowling-make-money-from-the-harry-potter-movies data-injectable=false>Does J.K. Rowling make money from the ‘Harry Potter’ movies?</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wegotthiscovered.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/02/GettyImages-1388451964.jpg><p data-characters=304 data-current-count=304 data-injectable=false>Rowling earns her fortune through the entire Wizarding World franchise. Meaning that for every book, film, theme park ticket, and merchandise sold, she receives a cut. This is because she owns the IP for the franchise, including the characters and the stories surrounding them. This also includes movies.</p><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-rich is-provider-twitter wp-block-embed-twitter" data-current-count=604 data-injectable=true><p lang=en dir=ltr>I read my most recent royalty cheques and find the pain goes away pretty quickly. <a href=#>pic.twitter.com/s4gl9rlqxl</a></p>— J.K. Rowling (@jk_rowling) <a href=#>October 13, 2022</a></figure><p data-characters=559 data-current-count=559 data-injectable=true><a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">The New York Times</a>&nbsp;reported that Rowling sold the rights for the first four Harry Potter movies for $2 million, with the deal stipulating she would also receive a percentage of net profits. This means that she earns a cut whenever a movie ticket or DVD is sold. According to&nbsp;<a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Pop Sugar</a>, this deal also extends to streaming. It’s also reported that Rowling holds a “creative stake” in the franchise so while it’s unknown how much she has earned from streaming platforms, it’s no secret that gets some sort of cut from every deal.</p><p data-characters=349 data-current-count=349 data-injectable=false>At the end of the day, Rowling will make money, whether it’s through books, films, merch, or video games, thanks to the agreements made for licensing and distribution rights. So whether you want to separate the art from the artist, just note that anything Harry Potter-related that’s sold will lead to Rowling receiving some sort of cut.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivlZy8tcDHoqqcp6aav6awjZympmedpMOqsdJom6ido2K3breMq6awpJmjtG65wKScZqWfo7K6ecWrpqZlpJ2ybrTAq6myZaCkwbWx0WakqK6ZmsBw</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
