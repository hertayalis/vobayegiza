After the North Carolina MC had tapped out of the battle following his "7 Minute Drill" diss and apologizing for it two days later, many clowned his decision and expressed disappointment or even anger towards him due to his exit. Well, now we know <a href=# rel class="font-semibold hover:text-accent-color border-b-2 border-accent-color">exactly what he was avoiding</a>, and we can't imagine that he would've been cool with the drama-filled, seriously accusatory, and relentless nature of this war. <a href=# class="font-semibold hover:text-accent-color border-b-2 border-accent-color" rel>Benny The Butcher</a> was one of many MCs to agree with Cole's exit, speaking to Hype Fight recently on why he understands his decision.</p><p class="__className_619da4 text-dark-grey !leading-[1.9125rem] break-words text-[17px] lg:text-lg">"That’s my dog," Benny The Butcher labeled <a href=# class="font-semibold hover:text-accent-color border-b-2 border-accent-color" rel>J. Cole</a>, who had previously worked with him on the excellent Tana Talk 4 cut "Johnny P's Caddy." "Honestly, you can see how gossipy and everything that this battle’s turned into.

I probably would’ve went about it in a different way, but it’s like a gossip battle.

As has been painfully clear to see, Kendrick Lamar and Drake have no such boundaries. In fact, this feud has reopened a lot of conversations on whether rap beef ever goes too far in its lyrical nastiness, and on what it means for these MCs -– scratch that, grown fathers -– to trade blows like this. No matter where you fall on that side of the debate, certain Internet corners are far less concerned with their lyricism now.</p><p class="__className_619da4 text-dark-grey !leading-[1.9125rem] break-words text-[17px] lg:text-lg">On that front, though, Benny The Butcher and J. Cole are still two highly respected pen-wielders. The former even thinks that the latter is <a href=# rel class="font-semibold hover:text-accent-color border-b-2 border-accent-color">the best rapper alive</a>, which is high praise coming from another candidate in that race. If fans are lucky, they'll meet in the studio once more. You don't need accusations to craft cutting verses.</p><p>About The Author</p><p>Gabriel Bras Nevares is a music and pop culture news writer for HotNewHipHop.
