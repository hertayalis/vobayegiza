There had to be a little subterfuge. Of course with the best intentions!</p><p>“So much was happening, in such an off-the-cuff kind of way, that I found myself using whatever tools was available. Many times, I would use my cell phone if I had to. There was a lot of use of flip video, iPhone and piece of shit little cameras in that piece. I’d get access without the equipment, and so, once I was inside and they felt comfortable, I used whatever tool I could, which was usually little consumer-grade cameras.</p><p>“It wasn’t until Kanye and I built a rapport on the side that I think he started becoming interested in having me around. I basically spoke freely and challenged what was being made and why.”</p><p data-characters=202 data-current-count=244 data-injectable=false>You can check out the documentary below, if you wish.
