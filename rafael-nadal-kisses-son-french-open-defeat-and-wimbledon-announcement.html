Despite his loss, the 37-year-old appeared to put on a fight during the match.&nbsp;</p><p id=ew1TKlqGp1 data-wc=31>Without giving too much away, Rafael did not confirm whether this would be his final time at the French Open – the tournament he has won 14 times in his career.&nbsp;</p><p id=eyT59q8gBV data-wc=55>"I don't know if it's gonna be my last time here in front of you, not 100 per cent - but if it is I enjoyed it," he said.

It's difficult to say what's going on in the future, a big percentage that I won't be back but I can say 100 per cent I am enjoying playing and having fun."&nbsp;</p><p id=eCU90ZU-DU data-wc=65>He added: "Maybe in two months I'll say it's enough, but it's something I don't want yet and I want to be back on this court for the Olympics. I never could imagine when I was a kid that I would be here at almost 38 with all the success I had here.
