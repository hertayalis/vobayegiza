The girls may be criticized for many different reasons, but when it comes to selecting a garment to wear on the most important day of their lives, the Duggar brides did a phenomenal job. They looked just lovely walking down the aisle.</p><p id=par-2_74>The stars of 19 Kids and Counting and Counting On&nbsp;had a few things in common when it came to choosing their wedding gowns. For one thing, fans didn’t expect to see any plunging necklines or see-through bodices. Since all the Duggar girls had solemn church <a href=#>weddings</a> and dress modestly even on regular days, the wedding dresses all kept the women appropriately covered. But even with this rule, the dresses still looked chic and modern.</p><h2>Jill Duggar’s wedding dress</h2><p id=par-4_33>Jill Duggar wed Derick Dillard on June 21, 2014. For her <a href=#>spring wedding</a>, she chose pastel turquoise bridesmaids gowns that nicely accented her class A-line lace gown. Tiny cap sleeves completed the look.</p><p id=par-5_54>On the show, Jill <a href=#>explained</a> that choosing a dress isn’t as simple as just picking off the rack. “…You don’t really know until you try a dress on,” she said. “You can see something hanging up and be like, ‘Oh, I like it!’ But then [you can] put it on and be like, ‘Ugh.’”</p><p id=par-6_6>Clearly, Jill Duggar found a winner!</p><h2>Jessa Duggar’s wedding dress</h2><p id=par-8_55>Jessa Duggar and Ben Seewald tied the knot on November 1, 2014. Her ballgown style dress was unique because it wasn’t traditional white, but rather had a blush pink tint that matched her deep coral bridesmaid’s gowns. The bodice also had elaborate beading, making it a little more formal than some of her sister’s dresses.</p><p id=par-9_45>On the show, Jessa said, “I love that it has a little bit of sparkle to it but not too much. It’s blush-colored so it’s kind of got a little pink to it. Something a little different. It’s just a fun dress. I love it.”</p><h2>Jinger Duggar’s wedding dress</h2><p id=par-11_47>Unlike her sisters, Jinger Duggar opted for multi-hued bridesmaids gowns when she wed her husband Jeremy Vuolo on November 5, 2016. Jinger also chose a long train that looked regal and ¾ length lace sleeves reminiscent of the gown Kate Middleton wore when she wed Prince William.</p><p id=par-12_60>Gown designer Renee Miller explained, “Both Jinger and Jeremy desired for the dress to have what I call a ‘train fit for royalty.’” When Jinger tried on the three protocol dresses, she always looked at the train before she looked at the front, so I knew that was her heart. I wanted the train to be the center of attention.”</p><h2>Joy-Anna Duggar’s wedding dress</h2><p id=par-14_51>On May 26, 2017, Joy-Anna Duggar tied the knot with Austin Forsyth. Like Jinger, she chose a ¾ sleeve gown with lace embroidery throughout. The stark white of the gown contrasted beautifully against her deep navy bridesmaids dresses. Like all the other Duggar women, her dress was stylish, modest, and stunning.</p><p id=par-15_28>So who had the prettiest dress? That all depends on your taste. Each gown was unique and beautiful in its own way — just like the ladies themselves.</p><p id=par-16_40>The next Duggar daughter won’t get married for many years – Johannah is only 13! But in the meantime, it’ll be fun to watch the Duggar boys wed their beautiful brides and catch a glimpse of their wedding gowns, too.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7pLTEmqusoJWawW%2BvzqZmnqakmr%2B1rcinpJ6mpGTEqbXCoWSdrZecrrN5waugnZ1dna6ledOhnGaooprBtbXErKtmr5WZsaq6xmabq52jqHupwMylZg%3D%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
