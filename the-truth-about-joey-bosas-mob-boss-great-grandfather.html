Around the same time, Joey's uncle Eric Kumerow also played defense for the Dolphins, overlapping with John before his own retirement in 1990. 
But Joey's NFL legacy doesn't stop there: Kumerow's father, Palmer Pyle, played professionally from 1960 to 1966 with teams including the Baltimore Colts, the Minnesota Vikings, and the Oakland Raiders."><link rel=stylesheet href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/cayman/css/normalize.css><link href="https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans:400,700" rel=stylesheet type=text/css><link rel=stylesheet href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/cayman/css/cayman.css><link rel=apple-touch-icon sizes=180x180 href=./apple-touch-icon.png><link rel=icon type=image/png sizes=32x32 href=./favicon-32x32.png><link rel=icon type=image/png sizes=16x16 href=./favicon-16x16.png><link rel=stylesheet href=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/katex@0.10.2/dist/katex.min.css integrity=sha384-yFRtMMDnQtDRO8rLpMIKrtPCD5jdktao2TV19YiZYWMDkUR5GQZR/NOVTdquEx1j crossorigin=anonymous><script defer src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/katex@0.10.2/dist/katex.min.js integrity=sha384-9Nhn55MVVN0/4OFx7EE5kpFBPsEMZxKTCnA+4fqDmg12eCTqGi6+BB2LjY8brQxJ crossorigin=anonymous></script>

Joey isn't the only NFL player of his generation:&nbsp;Joey's <a href=#>brother Nick Bosa</a>&nbsp;has played for the San Francisco 49ers since 2019. And, although both Nick and Joey are remiss to talk about their connections to their great-grandfather, they have still managed to end up in hot water over family ties. In 2018, former NFL coach Rex Ryan accused both brothers of habitually milking football-related injuries, simultaneously implying through a jab at their father, John, that they were able to do so because of their bonafide NFL-based family dynasty (via the <a href=#>New York Post</a>).
