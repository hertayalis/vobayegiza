The World No.4 has been linked with signing with the Saudi-backed Series, but when asked about them ahead of the Rocket Mortgage Classic, he admitted that while money is a big motivation, rumours that he will join LIV straight after the FedEx Cup are not true.
“I don't take too much stock in outside noise,” said the seven-time PGA Tour winner."><link rel=stylesheet href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/cayman/css/normalize.css><link href="https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans:400,700" rel=stylesheet type=text/css><link rel=stylesheet href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/cayman/css/cayman.css><link rel=apple-touch-icon sizes=180x180 href=./apple-touch-icon.png><link rel=icon type=image/png sizes=32x32 href=./favicon-32x32.png><link rel=icon type=image/png sizes=16x16 href=./favicon-16x16.png><link rel=stylesheet href=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/katex@0.10.2/dist/katex.min.css integrity=sha384-yFRtMMDnQtDRO8rLpMIKrtPCD5jdktao2TV19YiZYWMDkUR5GQZR/NOVTdquEx1j crossorigin=anonymous><script defer src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/katex@0.10.2/dist/katex.min.js integrity=sha384-9Nhn55MVVN0/4OFx7EE5kpFBPsEMZxKTCnA+4fqDmg12eCTqGi6+BB2LjY8brQxJ crossorigin=anonymous></script>

So never losing sight of the fact that you're only two wins in a row from being the hottest player on the planet, that's a funny thing in our game. I think maybe wins are maybe a little overweighted as far as how good a golf you're playing on a week-to-week basis, but that's the name of the game in our sport, it's how many wins an what tournaments did you win.</p><p>“My game's in a really good spot. I've been trying to double down on the process that got me to where I am, not change a whole lot and just look for small incremental improvements and I think the consistent play I've had this year is a testament to that."</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7qLvLn6SopqSdubp6wqikaKaVrMBwvMCtqaKbm2KworrTpZiyZZlisbC602afmq6VYq6vxYypo5qmo2LBsHnJqKCnZZyew26txa2cq2WWmrGmxIycrKk%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
