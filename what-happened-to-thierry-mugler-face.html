He constantly surprised fashion lovers with outfits pushing the boundaries of femininity and elegance. A former dancer, Thierry experimented with his image as well, opting for surgery to alter his look after several accidents.</p><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Source: Twitter</a></figure><h2 data-header=true class="sc-WZYaI IusWG">"I'm a superhero, so it’s normal to have the face of one," Thierry Mugler told 'Interview' in 2019.</h2><p>"I had several accidents. One was crashing in a Jeep, during which my nose was completely destroyed," Thierry told <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Interview</a> in 2019. "Another motorcycle accident involved steel cables, after which I had to remove a piece of metal from my leg. There was all this anesthesia and stuff, and I could never motivate myself to go back to the hospital because I’m so busy."</p><p>"The surgeon was screaming at me because they had to take this piece of metal out of my leg," he added. "So I said, 'Let’s find a way to make this fun!' I asked another surgeon if he could do some things to my chin, and then I was happy to get the bloody anesthesia. I wanted my face to represent progress. After years of being a thin, charming dancer, I wanted to be a warrior. I’ve done so much in my life. I’ve fought so much. I'm a superhero, so it’s normal to have the face of one."</p><figure class="sc-bYwzba cYmwOA"><a href=# style=background:#fff;line-height:0;padding:0;text-align:center;text-decoration:none;width:100%>View this post on Instagram</a><p style="color:#c9c8cd;font-family:Arial,sans-serif;font-size:14px;line-height:17px;margin-bottom:0;margin-top:8px;overflow:hidden;padding:8px 0 7px;text-align:center;text-overflow:ellipsis;white-space:nowrap"><a href=# style=color:#c9c8cd;font-family:Arial,sans-serif;font-size:14px;font-style:normal;font-weight:400;line-height:17px;text-decoration:none>A post shared by Manfred Thierry Mugler (@manfredthierrymugler)</a></p><span>Source: Instagram</span></figure><h2 data-header=true class="sc-WZYaI IusWG">Thierry Mugler set out to transform his body in the 2000s.
