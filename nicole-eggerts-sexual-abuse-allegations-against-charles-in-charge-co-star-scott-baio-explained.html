Eggert, for her part, doubled down with a spot on Megyn Kelly Today a few days later.&nbsp;</p><p data-characters=445 data-current-count=445 data-injectable=true>During the interview, Eggert claimed that she was abused by Baio “about once a week” when she was between the ages of 14 and 16 and he was in his 20s. She detailed instances of being touched inappropriately and claimed that fellow members of the cast of <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Charles in Charge</a> had witnessed fondling and kissing on set when she was underage. Eggert went on to repeat her previous assertion that she had lost her virginity to Baio when she was 17.</p><p data-characters=249 data-current-count=249 data-injectable=false>Explaining why she hadn’t come forward with her story before, Eggert explained that “(…)it was always protecting the show and protecting that whole legacy — that nothing happened. That was my delusion and that was my cover-up, always.”</p><p data-characters=343 data-current-count=592 data-injectable=true>Baio, meanwhile, continued to deny any wrongdoing, stating that, like all good guys, he waited until the child he’d been working with for years had turned 18 before getting intimate with her. Furthermore, he remained steadfast in his recollection that Eggert had seduced him, showing up at his house after Charles in Charge was off the air.</p><p data-characters=427 data-current-count=427 data-injectable=false>He alleged that Eggert had made her claims in a shot at cheap publicity, which would seem like a bold assertion if it wasn’t coming from a guy who actively promoted Sandy Hook conspiracy theories on social media. Eggert went on to state that she’d been advised of legal options, including a possible liable suit thanks to Baio’s claims that she had lied about the whole affair. As of 2024, no legal action has been taken.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivlZy8tcDHoqqcp6aav6awjZympmeTmrmmrtGiq6Kdo2S7qq%2FOpZxmnZecsrPA0maqnrCllrlurcGuqp5lkaG5prPAraCopqNirqityKeqrWWTna6zuMSsZKKmXZi1or7GnmScp12owaK%2BjKyaqKykYq%2Bitc5mnLGonJa2r7HDaA%3D%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
