The President addressed the terror attack at hand, and revealed that Skrulls lived amongst humanity on Earth. He finished his speech by announcing a war against this alien species.</p><p data-characters=390 data-current-count=390 data-injectable=false>This led to a brand new secret alliance forged by Sonya Falsworth and G’iah, with both agreeing to only cooperate for the sake of protecting their species, and leave “love and friendship” out of it. One of their missions led to the discovery of another Skrull kidnapping, where more humans were captured by these shapeshifting aliens due to Ritson’s war on Skrulls.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wegotthiscovered.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/Secret-Invasion-3.jpg><p data-characters=455 data-current-count=455 data-injectable=true>Nick Fury called President Ritson one last time before the former returned to S.A.B.E.R., telling him that his “hate speech” against the Skrulls caused more problems. Aside from peaceful Skrulls getting killed by the President’s hit squad, innocent people were also killed due to vigilantes. He urged the President to call off his war, but to no avail, with Ritson claiming that the only way forward was to remove the Skrulls from Earth.</p><p data-characters=520 data-current-count=520 data-injectable=true>Also before his departure, Fury’s wife Priscilla (or Varra) catches up to him. She forgives the man she loves, while showing him her true Skrull self. Fury tells his wife that the Kree were open to peace talks with the Skrulls, but Varra has doubts. Fury asks his wife to be the Skrulls’ diplomat during this peace summit, and that he’s better when they’re together. His wife agrees, but reminds her husband that she has to return to Earth at some point because she still has unfinished business.</p><p data-characters=303 data-current-count=303 data-injectable=false>While <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">there were no post-credit scenes</a> in this Marvel series, the ending may perhaps hint at what is to come in <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">The Marvels</a>, since the Kree will return in the upcoming feature. Will Earth show more prejudice against any intergalactic species? Or will later Marvel titles turn those hateful views around?</p><p data-characters=79 data-current-count=382 data-injectable=false>All episodes of Secret Invasion are now available for streaming on Disney Plus.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivlZy8tcDHoqqcp6aav6awjZympmekq3yurdGvnKVlo6nCpbXOrGSsnZOnsrV5yKetmquZpLtusc2doKefXZrFsbjAoqWenF8%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
