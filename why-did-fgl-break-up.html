The U.S. Presidential election in 2020 brought out a difference of opinion.</p><p>Tyler and his wife, Hayley, unfollowed Brian on Instagram — which eagle-eyed fans immediately took to be an ominous sign.

According to <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">The Tennessean</a>, their musical endeavors may have come to an end, but the twosome hasn't decided on the future of their business ventures. As the outlet states, no plans have been announced concerning the future of the FGL House, a four-story, 22,000-square-foot restaurant located just a stone's throw away from the Johnny Cash Museum in Nashville, Tenn.</p><p>Tyler has already put plans in place to continue his career in music as a solo artist. He released his debut solo EP, titled "Dancin' in the Country," in August 2022. "Dancin' in the Country" features five songs, "Baby Gets Her Lovin,'" "Everybody Needs a Bar,"<strong> </strong>"Inside and Out," "I'm the Only One,"<strong> </strong>and "5 Foot 9." Tyler's list of collaborators is very impressive. Keith Urban, Jon Nite, and Ross Copperman have all contributed to the record.</p><figure class="sc-bYwzba cYmwOA"><a href=# style=background:#fff;line-height:0;padding:0;text-align:center;text-decoration:none;width:100%>View this post on Instagram</a><p style="color:#c9c8cd;font-family:Arial,sans-serif;font-size:14px;line-height:17px;margin-bottom:0;margin-top:8px;overflow:hidden;padding:8px 0 7px;text-align:center;text-overflow:ellipsis;white-space:nowrap"><a href=# style=color:#c9c8cd;font-family:Arial,sans-serif;font-size:14px;font-style:normal;font-weight:400;line-height:17px;text-decoration:none>A post shared by Brian Kelley (@briankelley)</a></p></figure><p>Tyler has already confirmed that he has an even more exciting endeavor to broach, a studio album.

"And I even called him and told him, I said, 'Hey buddy, I love you. And I love you a lot more in real life than on your Stories right now. That's why I'm unfollowing you. Nothing personal. I still love you. You're still my brother."</p><p style=text-align:left>"So we've had moments where we wanted to kill each other, but a lot of it's out of love," he added.
