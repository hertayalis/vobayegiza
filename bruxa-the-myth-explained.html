The first season of the series followed Geralt of Rivia, portrayed by Henry Cavill, on his monster-slaying adventures and was extremely popular among viewers. Almost immediately there were calls for a Season 2, and Netflix delivered. It is in this new season that we get introduced to Vereena, a Bruxa who crosses paths with Geralt during his new journey.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p dir=ltr>Per <a href=#>CBR</a> (and in keeping with part of the Bruxa legend), Vereena's physical appearance changes numerous times during the new season. One of her animal forms resembles a bat with pale skin, while in other scenes she is described as more ghost-like when she looks human. This Bruxa differs from the legend as she also has a powerful scream and the Witcher must use a silver sword instead of steel to protect himself. However, despite her portrayal as a bloodthirsty-<a href=#>witch</a>-turned-vampire-shapeshifter-hybrid, it also appears she is also given some slightly more <a href=#>relatable qualities</a> during this season. If you want to see more of Vereena, The Witcher Season 2 is now streaming on Netflix.&nbsp;</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7qL7Up56eZpOkunCDkGtwcG5fl7%2B2xMBmq6GdXaLGtbSMnq%2BppJGeu6awjg%3D%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>.
