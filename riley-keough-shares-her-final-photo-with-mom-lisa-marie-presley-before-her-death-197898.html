She was&nbsp;</span><a href=#>rushed to the hospital</a><span>&nbsp;but died shortly thereafter.

Within the letter, it was announced that </span><a href=# rel>Riley and Ben welcomed their first child together</a><span>, a daughter.&nbsp;</span></p><p><span>"I'm going to read something Riley wrote," Ben said before reading her prepared words, titled "A Letter to My Mama."</span></p><p><span>"Thank you for being my mother in this life. I am eternally grateful to have spent 33 years with you. I am certain I chose the best mother for me in this world, and I knew that as far back as I can remember you," she wrote. "I remember everything. I remember you giving me baths as a baby. I remember you driving me in my car seat, listening to Aretha Franklin. I remember the way you'd cuddle me when I'd come to your bed at night, and the way you smelled."</span></p><p><span>"I remember you taking me for ice cream after school in Florida. I remember you singing to me and my brother lullabies at night, and how you'd lay with us until we fell asleep," Ben read, his voice filled with emotion. "I remember how, every time you'd leave town, you'd bring me a new tea set from Cracker Barrel."</span></p><p><span>"I remember all the notes you'd leave in my lunchbox every day. I remember the feeling I'd get when I'd see you picking me up from school, and the way your hand felt on my forehead," Riley's eulogy recalled. "I remember how it felt to be loved by the most loving mother I've ever known. I remember how safe it felt to be in your arms. I remember that feeling as a child and I remember it two weeks ago on your couch."</span></p><p><span>"Thank you for showing me that love is the only thing that matters in this life. I hope I can love my daughter the way you loved me, and the way you loved my brother and my sisters," Ben read.</span></p><p><span>"Thank you for giving me strength, my heart, my empathy, my courage, my sense of humor, my manners, my temper, my wildness, my tenacity," he concluded. "I am a product of your heart. My sisters are a product of your heart. My brother is a product of your heart. We are you, you are us, my eternal love. I hope you finally know how loved you were here. Thank you for trying so hard for us. If I didn't tell you every day, thank you."</span></p><p><strong><span>RELATED CONTENT</span></strong><span>:&nbsp;</span></p><p class=label>Video</p><a class=title href=#>Priscilla Presley Thanks Fans and Friends for Support Following Lisa Marie's Memorial</a><a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer" class=tile__link><span style="box-sizing:border-box;display:inline-block;overflow:hidden;width:initial;height:initial;background:0 0;opacity:1;border:0;margin:0;padding:0;position:relative;max-width:100%"><span style="box-sizing:border-box;display:block;width:initial;height:initial;background:0 0;opacity:1;border:0;margin:0;padding:0;max-width:100%"></span></span><p>Oscars</p><h3 class=tile__title><span>Austin Butler Honors Lisa Marie Presley Following 'Elvis' Oscar Nom</span></h3></a><a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer" class=tile__link><span style="box-sizing:border-box;display:inline-block;overflow:hidden;width:initial;height:initial;background:0 0;opacity:1;border:0;margin:0;padding:0;position:relative;max-width:100%"><span style="box-sizing:border-box;display:block;width:initial;height:initial;background:0 0;opacity:1;border:0;margin:0;padding:0;max-width:100%"></span></span><p>News</p><h3 class=tile__title><span>Priscilla Presley Speaks Out After Lisa Marie's Graceland Memorial</span></h3></a><a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer" class=tile__link><span style="box-sizing:border-box;display:inline-block;overflow:hidden;width:initial;height:initial;background:0 0;opacity:1;border:0;margin:0;padding:0;position:relative;max-width:100%"><span style="box-sizing:border-box;display:block;width:initial;height:initial;background:0 0;opacity:1;border:0;margin:0;padding:0;max-width:100%"></span></span><p>News</p><h3 class=tile__title><span>Ben Smith-Petersen: What to Know About Riley Keough's Husband</span></h3></a><a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer" class=tile__link><span style="box-sizing:border-box;display:inline-block;overflow:hidden;width:initial;height:initial;background:0 0;opacity:1;border:0;margin:0;padding:0;position:relative;max-width:100%"><span style="box-sizing:border-box;display:block;width:initial;height:initial;background:0 0;opacity:1;border:0;margin:0;padding:0;max-width:100%"></span></span><p>News</p><h3 class=tile__title><span>How Elvis Inspired Blackwood Brothers' Songs at Lisa Marie Memorial</span></h3></a><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7psDOp6OippVjsLC5jqugpZ2pYrimu9Sgn2armJa%2Fpr%2BMoZyrZZaeu6K4jKmfqKyfYsSqwMdmpKilXaG2tK2MppiroZVivbOx0qWcsmWSmrOwvsRmn56qXZmyosDHZmhyb2huhQ%3D%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
