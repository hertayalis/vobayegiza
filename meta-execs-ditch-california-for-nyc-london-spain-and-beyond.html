Instagram chief Adam Mosseri, Meta chief marketing officer Alex Schultz and global affairs president Nick Clegg have all either moved already or plan to move to England this year.</p><p>Clegg — the former leader of the Liberal Democratic Party and UK deputy prime minister — reports directly to Zuckerberg and leads all of Meta’s dealings with governments around the world.&nbsp;</p><p>He wants to be closer to his parents and sees London as a better location to travel to continental Europe and Asia, <a href=#>the Financial Times reported</a>. Meta is <a href=#>facing tough antitrust challenges</a> from regulators in both the US and Europe.</p><p>Mosseri, meanwhile, will help recruit Instagram staffers while he lives temporarily in the UK, where tech talent is as much as three times cheaper than in San Francisco, according to Financial Times.&nbsp;</p><figure class="nyp-slideshow-modal-image wp-block-image size-large">Meta’s global affairs president Nick Clegg is returning to London. <span class=credit>NurPhoto via Getty Images</span></figure><figure class="nyp-slideshow-modal-image wp-block-image size-large">Instagram chief Adam Mosseri is also moving to London. <span class=credit>Anadolu Agency via Getty Images</span></figure><p>As Meta shares have plunged more than 50% so far this year amid slowing growth and competition from TikTok, Zuckerberg has cracked the whip and urged managers to <a href=#>oust low-performing employees</a>.
